### **Overview**

This project is a simple, text-based Hangman game built in Python. The game selects a secret word from a predefined list, and the player tries to guess the word one letter at a time. The core functionality includes:

* **Predefined Word List:** A list of 5 words is hard-coded into the program.
* **Game Loop:** A `while` loop continues until the player either guesses the word correctly or runs out of incorrect guesses.
* **Input Handling:** The program prompts the user for a single letter guess and validates the input.
* **Tracking Progress:** The game keeps track of correctly guessed letters and the number of incorrect guesses.
* **Display:** The game displays the current state of the word (with correctly guessed letters filled in and unguessed letters as underscores), the number of remaining incorrect guesses, and a list of all letters guessed so far.
* **Win/Loss Conditions:** The game ends with a "win" message if the player successfully guesses the word or a "game over" message if they reach 6 incorrect guesses.

The final code will be a single Python script that can be run from the console without any external files or libraries beyond what is standard.# code-alpha-task1
